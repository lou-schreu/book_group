# Book Club

The NHS R Community has had a book group since 2020 and we meet every other Friday to discuss agreed chapters of whatever we're reading at the time. 

We've read (in order):

* [Art of Statistics](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/art_of_statistics), David Spielgelhalter
* [The Book of Why](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/the_book_of_why), Judea Pearl
* [Invisible Women](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/invisible_women), Caroline Criado Perez
* [R4DS](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/r4ds), Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund [link to book online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

The format has changed over time, depending on the book being read. For the first 3, a member of the group gave a 10-15 minute presentation at the beginning of each session to refresh everyone and give their take, and these presentations are archived in their corresponding folders (with a CC0 licence, naturally ðŸ˜ƒ).

We will start reading the R4DS book on Friday 12th November 2021 (2nd week of the NHS-R Conference), 2-3pm and we'll cover chapter 2 (intro - very short) and chapter 3.1-3.5 with the exercise of 3.5.1 on facets. We discuss and share the meeting links on the NHS-R Community Slack group nhsrcommunity.slack.com in the #book-club channel.
