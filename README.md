# Book Club

The NHS R Community has had a book group since 2020 and we meet every other Friday to discuss agreed chapters of whatever we're reading at the time. 

We've read (in order):

* [Art of Statistics](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/art_of_statistics), David Spielgelhalter
* [The Book of Why](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/the_book_of_why), Judea Pearl
* [Invisible Women](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/invisible_women), Caroline Criado Perez
* [R4DS](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/book_group/tree/main/r4ds), Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund [link to book online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

The format has changed over time, depending on the book being read. For the first 3, a member of the group gave a 10-15 minute presentation at the beginning of each session to refresh everyone and give their take, and these presentations are archived in their corresponding folders (with a CC0 licence, naturally ðŸ˜ƒ).

The R for Data Science has been a bit more relaxed in format and we've discussed a bit of the book and worked on the exercises together. 2022 we'll be suggesting reading in advance and working through exercises together (or bringing what you've completed along for discussion).

New for 2023!
We are reading the [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) second edition and recreating the [Unofficial Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) in quarto https://nhs-r-community.github.io/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions/.
