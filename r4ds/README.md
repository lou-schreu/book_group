[R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund perhaps doesn't need much introduction but this is the go-to book for many on learning about R and the tidyverse packages for plotting (ggplot2) and manipulating data (dplyr).

The [unoffical solution](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) is a really useful addition to the R4DS but doesn't appear to be updated so some of the chapter numbers are out of synch. There may be further differences in due course as the R4DS is being reviewed.
